# Ticketmaster Ticket Pricing Strategies

  Ticket pricing is a topic that is largely unexplored at Ticketmaster because it is generally not the one to set the price. The Data Science Division at Ticketmaster is very interested in insights into how to price tickets. Currently the ticket prices for a touring artist are roughly the same at every performance location, i.e. there is little to no optimization done on pricing tickets based on location. Ticketmaster is very interested in determining the popularity of certain geographic locations for certain types of events and for certain types of people so that it can use this information for ticket price optimization. 
 

## Data Description: 

* All of the data presented are web-based statistics. While the files look quite different from each other, the data are generated through the same process. When customers visit a website and the website loads, several javascript scripts are run during the loading process. This collect of scripts (referred to internally as a pixel) records the user's actions on the website and sends the resulting data to an external database. 
 
* The dataset we were using is "Purchase Data". Each row in the purchase dataset represents a purchase from Ticketmaster. This dataset contains information on what event the purchase was for, the type and date of event, cost of tickets, etc.
